                So let's talk. This is a website meant for people who want a light-weight exercise tracking web app that doesn't bundle a
                bunch of social media junk. Let's just be honest: no one wants to be going around sharing with their friends
                and coworkers how much they weigh or how often we all don't actually exercise.

                In addition a lot of simple, quality-of-life features that you would expect to be available in every workout app are so often
                greedily locked behind paywalls as well (Looking at you MyFitnessPal) and this service will offer these features
                for free, for everyone. Boy is my face going to be red if this site ever takes off and I start charging people
                for "Pro Accounts" or the ability to convert between simple measurements.
